You apply what you learned in this unit to create your own digital art space â€” an app that displays an array of artwork that you can showcase. Unlike previous codelabs in which you were given step-by-step instructions to follow, here you're only provided with guidelines and suggestions about what you can build with the concepts that you learned so far. You're encouraged to use your creativity to build the app independently with limited guidance.

It's a challenge to build an app on your own, but don't worry because you have had enough practice! You can use the same skills that you've learned in this new context. You can always refer to previous codelabs if you're unsure how to implement certain parts of the app.

When you build this app on your own and solve the problems that you face along the way, you learn faster and retain the concepts longer. As a side benefit, the app is completely customized, so you can use it to showcase your creation as part of your developer portfolio!

Warning: Don't use assets that you don't own or have appropriate rights to use for your app.

Prerequisites
Ability to create and run a project in Android Studio.
Experience with Kotlin syntax, which includes Boolean and when expressions.
Ability to apply basic Jetpack Compose concepts, such as the use of state with MutableState object.
Experience with composable functions, which includes Text, Image, and Button composables.

What you'll learn
How to build low-fidelity prototypes and translate them to code.
How to build simple layouts with Row and Column composables, and arrange them with horizontalAlignment and verticalArrangement parameters.
How to customize Compose elements with a Modifier object.
How to identify states and modify them upon triggers, such as button taps

What you'll build
An Android app that can display artwork or family photos

What you'll need
A computer with Android Studio installed.
Photos or digital art to display in the app.
